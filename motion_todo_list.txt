1. Integrity checks post copy - file counts at least 
2. Logic on file counts to recover non copied files
3. Purge the local machine on successful copy - currently managed separately
4. Expand to backing up other assets - would require recursive backup through folder structures - rsync?
5. Linked to above - loop through a list of assets or to next oldest asset
6. Backup to cloud storage?
